Apps that I am aware of but I can't work with beacuse I don't have books:
 - ~~Appbook (might be a shitty html webview)~~
 - Digimparo (giuntitvp instance)
 - Vitalsource (american platform, very good protection)
 - digibook24 ("The platform was developed by bsmartlabs"?)
 - Edisco Flowbook (more giuntitvp-like garbage?)

## TODO
 - Make a CLI interface with argparser
 - Token versioning
 - pdfgrabber versining
 - Add anonymous user
 - ~~Add ability to pass options to scripts~~
 - Add "perfect" token checks
 - General code quality improvement (better management of exceptions)
 - Make toc and labels generation raise non-critical warnings
