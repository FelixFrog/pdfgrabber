Apps that I am aware of but I can't work with beacuse I don't have books:
 - ~~Appbook (might be a shitty html webview)~~
 - Digimparo (giuntitvp instance)
 - Vitalsource (american platform, very good protection)
 - digibook24 ("The platform was developed by bsmartlabs"?)
 - Edisco Flowbook (more giuntitvp-like garbage?)

## TODO
 - Make a CLI interface with argparser
 - Token versioning
 - pdfgrabber versining
 - Add anonymous user
 - ~~Add ability to pass options to scripts~~
 - Add "perfect" token checks
 - General code quality improvement (better management of exceptions)
 - Make toc and labels generation raise non-critical warnings

# Installation
1. download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - on windows, when installing though the set up wizard, make sure to select the checkbox to add python to `PATH`
    - on linux and macos, use your package manager of choice (`brew install python3` or `apt install python3`, etc...)
2. downlaod the pdfgrabber repo
    - using git: `git clone https://github.com/FelixFrog/pdfgrabber.git`
    - manually: download the zip (green button labeled "code") and extract it
3. open your local clone of pdfgrabber
4. open the terminal in that directory and run:
    1) `pip install -r requirements.txt` (takes care of installing every needed libraries)
    2) run the script
        - `python3 main.py` (linux and macos) 
        - `py main.py` (windows)
5. once inside the pdfgrabber CLI:
    - press `r`: register a new account
    - choose what to do (it's listed):
       - to download a book: press `d` and follow the instructions.
       - the output file will be `files/<service>/<id>.pdf`

# Quirks
## Scuolabook
Scuolabook has shutdown on 01/01/2024
## Pearson
Both RPLUS_PDF and RPLUS_EPUB books are stored in a password protected zip file. Python's ZipFile module doesn't do the decryption natively, so it might take a (very) long time for some big books in the "Extracting zip" phase. If you have found a decent workaround let me know.
